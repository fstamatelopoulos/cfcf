# Installing cf²

cf² ships as a standard npm-format package: `@cerefox/codefactory`. The runtime is **Bun ≥ 1.3** — `bun install -g` resolves the heavy native deps (transformers, ORT, sharp) the same way every JS-ecosystem CLI does, and a per-platform `@cerefox/codefactory-native-<platform>` package supplies the pinned libsqlite3 + sqlite-vec libs.

**Prerequisites** — `git` + `bun` ≥ 1.3 (the curl-bash installer below installs Bun for you if it's missing).

## Recommended install — directly from npm

If Bun is already on your machine, this is the one-liner:

```bash
bun install -g @cerefox/codefactory             # latest
bun install -g @cerefox/codefactory@0.16.1      # pinned to a specific version
```

Bun's package manager fetches the CLI + the matching per-platform `@cerefox/codefactory-native-<platform>` (selected automatically by the `os`/`cpu` filters declared in the published `package.json`) + the runtime deps (transformers, ORT-node, sharp). One install, one command, no wrapper script needed.

After install: `cfcf doctor` to verify, `cfcf init` for first-run setup.

## Quick install — curl-bash wrapper

If you don't have Bun yet, the wrapper bootstraps it before doing the install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://<host>/install.sh | bash
```

Replace `<host>` with the URL the project announces. The script:

1. Detects whether Bun is on PATH; runs `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash` if not.
2. Picks an install source (defaults to **npm**; falls back to **tarball** when `CFCF_BASE_URL` is set or `CFCF_INSTALL_SOURCE=tarball` is passed — see "Tarball / offline / pinned-mirror install" below).
3. Runs the appropriate `bun install -g`.
4. Auto-installs **shell tab completion** for your `$SHELL` (writes the completion script + appends a sentinel-marked block to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`). See the [Shell completion section in `manual.md`](manual.md#shell-completion) for what gets added.
5. Hands off to `cfcf init` interactively. Set `CFCF_SKIP_INIT=1` to skip.

A bordered "next steps" banner prints at the end summarising the two one-time actions (open a new terminal to activate completion; restart `cfcf server` if it was running).

## Tarball / offline / pinned-mirror install

When you can't reach npmjs.com (airgapped CI, internal pinned mirror, hand-delivered tarball), the same `install.sh` switches to **tarball mode** and pulls the per-platform CLI + native tarballs from a base URL you provide. Tarball mode auto-engages when `CFCF_BASE_URL` is set; you can also force it with `CFCF_INSTALL_SOURCE=tarball`.

```bash
# 1. Drop the cf² + native tarballs + install.sh into a directory.
ls dist/
# cfcf-0.16.1.tgz
# cerefox-codefactory-native-darwin-arm64-0.16.1.tgz
# install.sh

# 2a. Local HTTP server:
bun run scripts/serve-dist.ts 8080     # in another shell
CFCF_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
CFCF_VERSION=v0.16.1 \
  bash dist/install.sh

# 2b. file:// URL (no server needed):
CFCF_BASE_URL="file://$(pwd)/dist" \
CFCF_VERSION=v0.16.1 \
  bash dist/install.sh

# 2c. GitHub Releases mirror (the script's tarball-mode default URL):
CFCF_INSTALL_SOURCE=tarball \
CFCF_VERSION=v0.16.1 \
  bash install.sh

# 2d. Or hand the tarball directly to bun (skips install.sh entirely):
bun install -g ./dist/cfcf-0.16.1.tgz
```

Notes:

- `CFCF_VERSION=latest` resolves via GitHub's release-redirect when the base URL points at a `releases/latest/download` path; for `file://` URLs the version must be explicit.
- The recognised env vars are `CFCF_INSTALL_SOURCE` (`npm` | `tarball`), `CFCF_VERSION`, `CFCF_BASE_URL`, `CFCF_RELEASES_REPO` (overrides the default `fstamatelopoulos/cfcf-releases` for the tarball-mode default URL), and `CFCF_SKIP_INIT`.

## What gets installed

`bun install -g` lays everything out under your Bun global prefix (default: `~/.bun/install/global/`). The tree:

```
$HOME/.bun/install/global/node_modules/
├── @cerefox/codefactory/                   # the CLI package
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── bin/cfcf.js                      # shebang stub
│   └── dist/cfcf.js                     # bundled JS (~1 MB)
├── @cerefox/codefactory-native-<platform>/     # only the matching one is installed
│   ├── libsqlite3.<dylib|so|dll>
│   └── sqlite-vec.<dylib|so|dll>
├── @huggingface/transformers/           # runtime deps, fetched from npmjs.com
├── onnxruntime-node/
└── sharp/
```

User data lives separately under `~/.cfcf/`:

```
~/.cfcf/
├── clio.db                   # cross-workspace memory (Clio)
├── logs/                     # per-workspace agent stdout/stderr
└── models/                   # downloaded embedder models (lazy on first use)
```

Run `cfcf doctor` after install to verify all health checks pass (the count grows over time as we add new diagnostics — currently 13+).

## Upgrading

The simplest path is `cfcf self-update`:

```bash
cfcf self-update                        # check + interactive upgrade
cfcf self-update --check                # check only; print latest vs current
cfcf self-update --yes                  # non-interactive
cfcf self-update --version v0.11.0      # install a specific tag
```

Internally this runs `bun install -g <new-tarball-URL>`. Bun's package manager handles the swap atomically — if the install fails, the previous version stays intact.

User data (`~/.cfcf/clio.db`, `~/.cfcf/logs/`, `~/.cfcf/models/`) is **never touched** by the install/upgrade flow. Only the npm package contents change.

## Uninstalling

```bash
bun remove -g @cerefox/codefactory         # one-liner

# Or via the wrapper (interactive, prints what gets preserved):
~/.cfcf/uninstall.sh                    # if you have it locally; otherwise just run the bun command
```

`bun remove -g` cleans up the cf² package + the platform-native package + the runtime deps. Your `~/.cfcf/` data dir is preserved on purpose; delete it manually with `rm -rf ~/.cfcf` if you want a clean wipe.

The platform-specific config dir (`~/Library/Application Support/cfcf/` on macOS; `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cfcf/` on Linux) is also preserved. Find it with `cfcf config show --path` *before* uninstalling.

## Troubleshooting

The full troubleshooting page is [`troubleshooting.md`](troubleshooting.md). The most-asked install-time issues:

### "cfcf: command not found" after install

Bun's global bin (`~/.bun/bin/`) isn't on PATH. Add it:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL
```

### Tab completion doesn't fire after install

90% of the time the fix is `rm ~/.zcompdump*; exec zsh` (force a clean compinit reload). See [troubleshooting.md → Tab completion doesn't work](troubleshooting.md#tab-completion-doesnt-work) for the full diagnosis.

### `cfcf doctor` reports "@cerefox/codefactory-native-<platform>: not installed"

`bun install -g` skipped the platform package because the npm registry didn't have it (private-distribution path during the cfcf-private phase: only the GitHub Release artefact has it). Install it manually:

```bash
bun install -g <tarball-URL>/cerefox-codefactory-native-<platform>-<version>.tgz
```

Or re-run `install.sh` against the Release URL — it pulls the right one for your platform.

### `Cannot find module '@huggingface/transformers'`

A network blip during install. Reinstall:

```bash
bun install -g @cerefox/codefactory       # or the tarball URL
```

### sqlite-vec / hybrid search doesn't work

`cfcf doctor` will flag the issue. The most common cause is a missing `@cerefox/codefactory-native-<platform>` package — see two items up.

### Bun warns about duplicate keys

Known Bun bug; cfcf's installer auto-dedups. See [troubleshooting.md → bun install warnings](troubleshooting.md#bun-install--g-warns-about-duplicate-keys).

## Platform support

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| darwin-arm64 (Apple Silicon) | ✅ |
| darwin-x64 (Intel Mac) | ✅ — kept first-class via the transformers 3.8.1 + ORT-node 1.21.0 pin |
| linux-x64 (glibc, Ubuntu 20.04+) | ✅ |
| linux-x64 (musl, Alpine) | ❌ — out of scope until requested |
| windows-x64 | 📅 follow-up phase. v1 ships Mac + Linux only. Use WSL on Windows. |
