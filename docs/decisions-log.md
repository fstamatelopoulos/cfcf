# cfcf Decisions & Lessons Log

**Purpose:** This log captures important decisions and lessons learned that are NOT already documented in `plan.md`, `design/technical-design.md`, or other design docs, and that are not obvious from git history. It serves as a quick reference to avoid repeating failed experiments and to preserve rationale for non-obvious choices.

**What to add here:**
- Failed experiments and why they didn't work (so we don't repeat them)
- Non-obvious implementation decisions that future developers would question
- Surprising gotchas discovered during development
- Performance findings that influenced design choices

**What NOT to add here:**
- Architectural decisions (those go in `plan.md` decision log)
- Design rationale (those go in `design/technical-design.md` or `design/cfcf-requirements-vision.md`)
- Bug fixes (those are in git history)

**Format:** Newest entries at the top. Each entry has a date and a brief explanation.

## Log

### 2026-04-11 -- bun test --recursive hangs with process-spawning tests

`bun test --recursive` hangs when test files include process manager tests that spawn + kill subprocesses (e.g., `sleep 30` with `kill()`). Running packages sequentially (`bun test packages/core && bun test packages/server && bun test packages/cli`) works reliably. Updated root `package.json` test script accordingly. Likely a Bun v1.3.12 bug with --recursive and concurrent subprocess management in tests.

### 2026-04-11 -- Server stop must use PID file or port scan

The `cfcf server start` spawns a background bun process. Shell job control (`kill %1`) is unreliable across shell contexts. For `cfcf server stop` to work reliably, we need either: (a) store the PID in a file at startup and read it at stop, or (b) scan for the process on the configured port via `lsof -ti :<port>`. Approach (a) is more robust. Will implement in iteration 1.

### 2026-04-11 -- Bun v1.3.12 confirmed on macOS

Bun installed via `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`. Version 1.3.12. Will need to verify Windows and Linux compatibility when cross-platform testing begins.
