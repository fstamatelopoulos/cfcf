# cfcf Decisions & Lessons Log

**Purpose:** This log captures important decisions and lessons learned that are NOT already documented in `plan.md`, `design/technical-design.md`, or other design docs, and that are not obvious from git history. It serves as a quick reference to avoid repeating failed experiments and to preserve rationale for non-obvious choices.

**What to add here:**
- Failed experiments and why they didn't work (so we don't repeat them)
- Non-obvious implementation decisions that future developers would question
- Surprising gotchas discovered during development
- Performance findings that influenced design choices

**What NOT to add here:**
- Architectural decisions (those go in `plan.md` decision log)
- Design rationale (those go in `design/technical-design.md` or `design/cfcf-requirements-vision.md`)
- Bug fixes (those are in git history)

**Format:** Newest entries at the top. Each entry has a date and a brief explanation.
