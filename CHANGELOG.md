## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] -- 2026-04-12

Iteration 1: Project management, process manager, git manager, CI pipeline.

### Added
- Project management: `cfcf project init/list/show/delete` with per-project config stored under `~/.cfcf/projects/`
- Global config commands: `cfcf config show`, `cfcf config edit`
- Process manager: spawn commands, stream logs, capture output to disk, kill/timeout support
- Git manager: feature branch creation (`cfcf/iteration-N`), commit, diff, reset, push, merge
- `cfcf run --project <name> -- <command>` executes the next iteration (creates branch, runs command, captures logs, commits)
- Server endpoints: project CRUD, `POST /api/projects/:id/iterate`, `GET /api/projects/:id/iterations/:n/logs` (SSE), `POST /api/shutdown`
- Reliable `cfcf server stop` using PID file and `/api/shutdown` endpoint
- Log storage at `~/.cfcf/logs/<project>/iteration-NNN-dev.log`
- GitHub Actions CI: test + typecheck on Ubuntu and macOS, cross-platform binary builds
- `bun run build` compiles a self-contained 64MB binary
- CLI usage guide: `docs/guides/cli-usage.md`
- 90 tests (169 assertions) covering all new components

### Changed
- Simplified execution model: removed "run" concept. Iterations are monotonically numbered per project (project → iteration, not project → run → iteration)
- `ProjectConfig` now tracks `currentIteration` counter
- SSE events renamed: `project.paused`, `project.completed` (was `run.*`)

## [0.0.0] -- 2026-04-11

Iteration 0: Project scaffolding, server skeleton, CLI, first-run configuration.

### Added
- Bun monorepo with `@cfcf/core`, `@cfcf/server`, `@cfcf/cli` workspace packages
- Hono-based HTTP server with `/api/health`, `/api/status`, `/api/config` endpoints
- Commander.js CLI with `cfcf init`, `cfcf status`, `cfcf server start/stop/status`
- First-run interactive configuration: agent detection, user prompts, permission acknowledgment
- Agent adapter interface with Claude Code and Codex CLI adapters
- Platform-specific config storage (XDG on Linux, Application Support on macOS, AppData on Windows)
- 35 tests (74 assertions) covering core config, adapters, server API, and CLI client
- Project documentation suite: requirements & vision (v0.4), tech stack, technical design, agent process & context, development plan, server API reference
- CLAUDE.md with project principles for AI coding agents
- docs/ structure: design/, api/, research/, guides/
